prefixtree
==========

This branch of `prefixtree` is archived and will receive no further updates.

There is now a new [version `v2`](https://github.com/beevik/prefixtree/tree/v2)
of prefixtree, which uses a generic type instead of an empty interface to
represent its values.  Please use this branch instead.
